tunesbot is a Discord bot that scans a channel for YouTube
video links and adds them to a YouTube playlist.

The bot is capable of:

- adding multiple videos from a single message
- scanning from where it left off in a previous execution

This bot uses Google's OAuth2 API to authenticate, and
the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube scope.

===============
Getting started
===============

You will need:

- a Discord bot application
- a Google Developers project and client credentials, with
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube scope
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/nodejs

These steps instruct how to obtain the initial access
token and refresh token for Google's APIs, as well as
configure the bot token etc.

Copy your client_secret.json to the secrets directory.

cd to the secrets directory and run the auth.sh script.

    $ cd private
    $ ./auth.sh

The script presents you with a web link to Google's
services. Go to this link in a web browser and follow the
steps. Paste the resulting code in the script's prompt.

The script should generate a token.json file, you may
confirm this.

...

In the same directory is example-config.json. Make a copy
of this file. Name the copy config.json and edit.

Now you may run the top-level demo.sh script to start the
bot. :)
